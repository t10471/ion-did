# ion-did

## what

I wrote this program based on [this article](https://medium.com/@a.a.lechner/tutorial-how-to-create-a-did-on-the-ion-network-d4b8ebca280a). It was rewritten from ion-tools because the functions of the dependent libraries have changed significantly.

### my did

The did can be seen [here](https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/?did=did%3Aion%3AEiCFy_47Z1f6HDJLxEf7c5atbGT4XEVbAhurGiCc8uzYGg).
